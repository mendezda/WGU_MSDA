# Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets. The following courses are prerequisites: The Data Analytics Journey, and Data Acquisition.

## Competencies
- Predict potential obstacles in data analysis based on data quality
- Prepare data for analysis to address organizational needs
- Write reusable code to manipulate and clean data

## Summary
This notebook demonstrates structured data preprocessing and visualization techniques, including conditional logic for categorical features.

## Tools Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`'s `decomposition`

## Key Results
- Applied conditional labeling and segmentation.
- Explored variable distributions across categories.
- Prepared the data for future classification or clustering.
